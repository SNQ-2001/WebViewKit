# ``WebViewKit``

WebViewKit adds a SwiftUI `WebView` that can be used to embed local and online web sites in your SwiftUI apps.



## Overview

The `WebView` view can load any url and be fully configured to fit your needs. For more basic needs, you have a `SafariWebView` as well.



## Installation

WebViewKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/WebViewKit.git
```

If you prefer to not have external dependencies, you can also just copy the source code into your app.



## Supported Platforms

WebViewKit supports `iOS 13` and `macOS 11`.



## About this documentation

The online documentation is currently iOS-specific. To generate documentation for other platforms, open the package in Xcode, select a simulator then run `Product/Build Documentation`.
